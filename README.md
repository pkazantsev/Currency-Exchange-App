# Currency Exchange App
A simple demo iOS app for a currency exchange written in Objective-C using [ReactiveObjC](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveObjC) lib. 

Fetches exchange rates from [ECB Daily Exchange Rates](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-daily.xml), 
refreshes every 30 seconds (though the source updates once a day).
